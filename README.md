# FoundryVTT - Snap Me Maybe

Foundry VTT module that snaps tokens to each other on gridless scenes instead of overlapping them.

## Settings

### Token Shape

What shape the tokens should be considered as when snapping.

### Sticky Keys

When enabled movement using the keyboard keys will result in colliding tokens sticking to each other instead of glancing or bouncing off.
